      %p
        Go to View in the menu
        %br
        Select Text SizeÂ 
        %br

        %br
        More guidance on IE8 can be found at:
        = link_to 'www.microsoft.com',
                  'https://www.microsoft.com',
                  target: '_blank'

      %h2.govuk-heading-l Links
      %p
        There are no JavaScript pseudo-links. All links can be followed in any browser, even if
        scripting is turned off. There are no links that open new windows without warning.

      %h2.govuk-heading-l Images
      %p
        All content images used on the site have descriptive ALT attributes.
        %p
          The site makes extensive use of Cascading Style Sheets and most images are in the
          'background' of the page and not registered by screen readers. This is worth noting when
          using the 'disable image' feature of some browsers.

      %h2.govuk-heading-l Standards compliance
      %p
        Gov.uk is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible
        audience, regardless of technology or ability. We are actively working to increase the
        accessibility and usability of our website and, in doing so, adhere to available standards
        and guidelines.
      %p
        This service endeavours to conform to WCAG 2 AA from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.
      %p
        Whilst we strive to adhere to the accepted guidelines and standards for accessibility and
        usability, it is not always possible to do so in all areas of the website. The secure areas
        of the site cannot be accessed through the Opera Browser and other browsers that share its
        User Agent (such as the text browser Lynx).
